# Optimal Estimator for the Reconstructed CMB Lensing Bispectrum  

This repository contains code for computing the optimal estimator of the reconstructed Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing bispectrum. This work is part of my PhD research and is under active development.   

## **Key Requirements**  
To eventually run this code, the following libraries and dependencies must be installed:  

- **[cmblensplus](https://github.com/toshiyan/cmblensplus)**: A toolkit for CMB lensing analysis.  
- **[CAMB](https://camb.info/)**: Code for calculating CMB power spectra.  
- **[lenspyx](https://github.com/carronj/lenspyx)**: Lensed CMB maps simulation package

## **Current Status**  
- **Development**: The code is currently under construction. 
- **Usability**: It is not yet user-friendly. Please wait for future updates or contact me for specific questions related to its use.
